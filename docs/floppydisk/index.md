# Floppy Disk Docs

Floppy Disk is an indie web project for creative documents that live on your
storage, not inside someone else’s platform. Keep notes, drafts, maps, and
research in plain files that you can move, back up, or remix anytime.

## Indie web principles

- Own the data. Your files are stored in a real folder on your storage.
- Use open formats. Markdown, PDFs, images, and text all remain portable.
- Avoid lock-in. You can move or sync your files without exporting.
- Keep it personal. Your workspace is yours, whether it is local, Dropbox, or a
  NAS.

## What you can do

- Write and read Markdown with a live preview.
- Drop in images, PDFs, and other files for reference.
- Organize folders for projects, campaigns, or research.
- Keep everything offline-first, with optional sync.
