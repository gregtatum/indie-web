# Browser Chords Docs

Browser Chords is focused on working with chord sheets and song files directly
in the browser. It is built around simple, portable files that you own.

## Why files, not another service

I wanted a way to organize sheet music that does not depend on a proprietary
service or a closed database. With plain files (ChordPro, PDFs, images), your
music stays yours. You can back it up, sync it, edit it with other tools, and
move it between devices without losing structure.

ChordPro is a great fit for this because it is readable in a text editor but
structured enough for software to do useful work like transposition. It means
your collection is durable, searchable, and future-proof.

## Highlights

- Render ChordPro files with live transpose and capo settings.
- Store songbooks locally, on Dropbox, or on your own file server.
- PDF viewing for lead sheets and charts.
- A single, standardized format for tabs, lyrics, and notes.
