# Offline files

While you passively view your files, {{SITE_DISPLAY_NAME}} can cache the files
to your browser allowing for faster retrieval and offline support for your
files. This is useful if you are viewing your music in a venue with a spotty internet
connection. Notice the small border around the icon of a file to know if it's available
offline or not.

If you are using the site on an iPad you can add a bookmark to your home screen. This
will make it easy to access the site as if it were a native app, and it increases the
amount and persistence of your in-browser storage. This makes it easy to use
{{SITE_DISPLAY_NAME}} as your digital sheet music.
