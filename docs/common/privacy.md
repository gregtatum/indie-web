# Privacy

See [the privacy policy](/privacy) for more detailed information, but in short:

## What stays local

When you use local browser storage, files never leave your device.

## What syncs

Remote stores like Dropbox sync files to your account. This enables access from
multiple devices.

## Usage data

This project avoids collecting usage data as much as possible, and file information is
never transmitted outside of the store itself.. Check the in-app privacy page for the
latest details.
