# Indie Web Docs

Welcome to the Indie Web docs. These pages cover common concepts shared by both
Browser Chords and Floppy Disk.

- File stores: where your files live and how to switch.
- Privacy: what data stays local vs stored remotely.

## About these tools

Both apps are focused on working with files in the browser. They share the same
core engine for file browsing, editing, and rendering.
