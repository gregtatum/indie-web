# File stores

## Local browser storage

Local storage keeps files in your browser using [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API). It is quick and private, but clearing
your browser data will remove all files. The files are tied to your browser.

## Dropbox

Connecting Dropbox lets you access files across devices. You can work offline
and sync changes when you reconnect.

## Server store

If configured, a server-backed store can keep files in a shared location.
