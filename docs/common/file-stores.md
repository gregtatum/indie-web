# File stores

## Local browser storage

Local storage keeps files in your browser. It is quick and private, but clearing
browser data will remove files.

## Dropbox

Connecting Dropbox lets you access files across devices. You can work offline
and sync changes when you reconnect.

## Server store

If configured, a server-backed store can keep files in a shared location.
