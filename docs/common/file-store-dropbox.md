# Dropbox

Use Dropbox when you want your files to sync across devices. Connect it at
[/dropbox](/dropbox) and the app will create a private
`Dropbox/Apps/{{SITE_DROPBOX_FOLDER}}` folder so the rest of your Dropbox stays untouched.

Once connected, you can open, edit, and organize your files like any other
file store, and access them outside of this site as they will be synced just like
normal files.
