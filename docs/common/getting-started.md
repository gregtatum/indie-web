# Getting started

## Choose a file store

Start by heading to the [/connect](connection page) to pick a storage option.

You can work with files stored locally in your browser, or connect a remote
store like Dropbox. Pick the store that matches where your files already live:

- [Local browser storage](/docs/file-store-browser.html)
- [Dropbox](/docs/file-store-dropbox.html)
- [Server store](/docs/file-store-server.html)

## Add files

Use the add button to create new files or folders. You can also drag files from
your desktop into the app to upload.

## Navigate

Folders and files are navigated using the left panel. File views open on the
right with the editor and preview.
