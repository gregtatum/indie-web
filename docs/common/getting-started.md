# Getting started

## Choose a file store

You can work with files stored locally in your browser, or connect a remote
store like Dropbox. Pick the store that matches where your files already live.

## Add files

Use the add button to create new files or folders. You can also drag files from
your desktop into the app to upload.

## Navigate

Folders and files are navigated using the left panel. File views open on the
right with the editor and preview.
